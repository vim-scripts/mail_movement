DESCRIPTION
This filetype plugin provides movement commands and text objects for email
quotes. 

USAGE
			A quoted email is determined either by: 
			- lines prefixed with ">" (one, or multiple for nested
			  quotes) 
			- an optional email separator (e.g.
			"-----Original Message-----") and the standard "From: <Name>"
			mail header, optionally followed by other header lines. 

			Move around email quotes of either: 
			- a certain nesting level, as determined by the current
			  line; if the cursor is not on a quoted line, any
			  nesting level will be used. 
			- the range of lines from the "From: <Name>" mail header
			  up to the line preceding the next email separator or
			  next mail header. 
]]			Go to [count] next start of an email quote. 
][			Go to [count] next end of an email quote. 
[[			Go to [count] previous start of an email quote. 
[]			Go to [count] previous end of an email quote. 

			Move to nested email quote (i.e. of a higher nesting
			level as the current line; if the cursor is not on a
			quoted line, any nesting level will be used). 
]+			Go to [count] next start of a nested email quote. 
[+			Go to [count] previous start of a nested email quote. 

aq			"a quote" text object, select [count] email quotes, i.e. 
			- contiguous lines having at least the same as the
			  current line's nesting level
			- one email message including the preceding mail headers
			  and optional email separator
iq			"inner quote" text object, select [count] regions with
			either: 
			- the same nesting level
			- the contents of an email message without the preceding
			  mail headers
