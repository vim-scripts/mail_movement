DESCRIPTION
This filetype plugin provides movement commands and text objects for email
quotes.

USAGE
                        A quoted email is determined either by:
                        - lines prefixed with ">" (one, or multiple for nested
                          quotes)
                        - an optional email separator (e.g.
                        "-----Original Message-----") and the standard "From: <Name>"
                        mail header, optionally followed by other header lines.

                        Move around email quotes of either:
                        - a certain nesting level, as determined by the current
                          line; if the cursor is not on a quoted line, any
                          nesting level will be used.
                        - the range of lines from the "From: <Name>" mail header
                          up to the line preceding the next email separator or
                          next mail header.
]]                      Go to [count] next start of an email quote.
][                      Go to [count] next end of an email quote.
[[                      Go to [count] previous start of an email quote.
[]                      Go to [count] previous end of an email quote.

                        Move to nested email quote (i.e. of a higher nesting
                        level as the current line; if the cursor is not on a
                        quoted line, any nesting level will be used).
]+                      Go to [count] next start of a nested email quote.
[+                      Go to [count] previous start of a nested email quote.

aq                      "a quote" text object, select [count] email quotes, i.e.
                        - contiguous lines having at least the same as the
                          current line's nesting level
                        - one email message including the preceding mail headers
                          and optional email separator
iq                      "inner quote" text object, select [count] regions with
                        either:
                        - the same nesting level
                        - the contents of an email message without the preceding
                          mail headers
